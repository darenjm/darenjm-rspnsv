        <p>This has been taking a long time. At least it feels like it. But it takes as long as it takes. Moving right along.</p>
        <p>Not going to write much, just a quick edit to this blog which is just a way to work with Guthub. I'm practicing uploading, version control and viewing my website on Github.io. Moving right along</p>
        <p>I've completed the navigation for the Holdtrade Atlantico website. Only took three days. But, I got it just the way I want. Three different versions - one for desktop, one for tablets and one for smaller devices like phones. I even figured out how to use jQuery. Moving right along.</p>

	 </header>
		<p>This weeks post will be a mostly unedited, stream of conceiousness session I had while riding the bus over two days last week. Here it is.</p>
		<p>Fear is fuel. Anxiety is the exhaust of burning that fuel. If you use fear to move or drive you forward you're staying ahead of the exhaust. If you allow fear to paralyse you you will choke on the fumes. Embrace fear, let it be the fuel for your engine and keep moving forward.</p>
		<p>I learned today from Jocko that one of the ways he is able to lead in stressful and dangerous times, even just function, is he detaches. Usually detaching leads to bad outcomes in everyday life, marriage in particular. But in this case I get it. If you can step back, take a birds eye view of yourself in the moment you can see things. You get perspective that you can't get up close. That is the approach I am going to take during this time of uncertainty and fear. I will stay ahead of the fumes of anxiety. I will detach from the moment and I will guide myself as if I am talking to a friend. I will see my situation from afar and look around and see things I just can't see from the the inside.

		 <h1 class="blog_head">JavaScript: Questions and Doubts</h1>
		 <p class="sig">January 15, 2017 &nbsp;| &nbsp;Daren Morreale</p>
	 </header>
		<p>It’s been two weeks now that I started learning JavaScript. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m doing what I’m doing. I am writing a lot of code, more or less copying and pasting. I don’t know if I’m actually learning anything. I’m frustrated and I am having doubts about the path I am on.</p>
		<p>I am questioning whether or not the class I have settled on is the right one. I started out on Udemy with the Complete Web developers Course. From there I switched to Free Code Camp, to Codecademy, then Watch and Code, to Pluralsight and finally to learn.co. I go by my gut most of the time and if it feels right I go for it. Learn.co feels right.</p>
		<p>What I like about learn.co is the quick responses from the experts that always seem to be on. And when they do respond they are patient and helpful. They don’t give me the answer, but they lead me to it so it feels like I figured it out myself. Which I guess I do, but I need a guide to help me in the fog.</p>
		<p>The fear is that I am never going to get it and be able to write or use JavaScript effectively. I don’t know what is going ... <a href="javaScript-questions.html">continue reading &raquo;</p></a>

		 <h1 class="blog_head">The JavaScript Learning Curve Gets Steep</h1>
		 <p class="sig">January 8, 2017 &nbsp;| &nbsp;Daren Morreale</p>
	 </header>
		<p>JavaScript is proving to be a tough challenge for me. I don't know what I'm doing or why I'm doing it yet and my brain is starting to hurt a little. Good, because it means it's growing - right?. I just read an excerpt from the book "Motzart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot" by Richard Restak, and in it he says that as we learn we are creating new connections in our brains. And as a result our brains gain weight. I wonder what the diet would look like?</p>
		<p>I wasn't expecting it to all be easy, and it's not. It makes no sense to me at this point. I'm just reading, copying and in-putting exactly what I'm being told to. Sometimes it works and sometimes I have to dig a little deeper. But until it clicks it's going to be a grind.</p>
		<p>I worked hard to condition myself to enjoy the grind. It wasn't always that way. I used to give up, a lot. I would think if it was hard that maybe it wasn't for me because it was supposed to be easy. What I learned is anybody can do easy and I have to enjoy the hard grind to master anything. Not everybody can do hard and that's  ... <a href="javaScript-learning.html">continue reading &raquo;</p></a>

		 <p class="sig">December 30, 2016 &nbsp;| &nbsp;Daren Morreale</p>
	 </header>
		<p>My first blog post, hello world. Thing are coming a long. I now know how to use HTML and CSS. It took me about 5 weeks to feel confidant with problem solving but now I’m sure I can figure it out. I’ve come up against a few challenges and was able to get it done. Feels good to do it to and it gets addictive after the taste of just a few small successes. I'm looking forward to problems now because I know it means I’m about to learn something. Obstacle is the way, and it is.</p>
		<p>I missed my goal of getting the first page up by December 16. I got it up on the 20th. I can live with that. Don’t need to be perfect, just need to make progress.</p>
		<p>Another goal I set is to code everyday. Even if I just get in a half hour. Just code. Look at code, read code, find a problem and solve it. Today was a day like that. This morning I ran out of time. Still got up at 4:30 but I felt I needed to focus on some writing this morning before I taught a class on Skype at 6:00. We have a full house for the holiday and things started to roll after that. I didn’t get to code at  ... <a href="html-css-code.html">continue reading &raquo;</p></a>

		  <h4 class="abt_line">About</h4>
		  <div class="about_text">
			<p>I am putting this site together to keep track of my progress as a web developer.  So far I have taught myself HTML, CSS a bit of PHP (enough to convert my static websites to WordPress ready dynamic sites) and SEO best practices.  The next step is JavaScript, but as of this writing, I’ve decided to just move ahead and use jQuery plug-ins when and where I need it.  Don’t want to get bogged down because I know the opportunity to learn JavaScript will come as I move along.</p> 
			<p>As I progress I will be building, re-building, revising and updating this site as I build my skills.  Everything will be designed and coded by me as a way to show my clients what I am capable of doing and how I can help them in their businesses.</p>  
			<p>I do have a background in graphic design (20 years).  I worked in print design, from big ad agencies in NYC to small design shops in San Francisco and Seattle, and I spent 2 and a half years building PowerPoint presentations, primarily for Microsoft ... a lot of Photoshop!</p>
			<p>I have always loved building things and I spent 5 years as a professional carpenter and a custom cabinet maker in Seattle. In this role I helped to remodel homes and build exhibits for museums in the Puget Sound area. Although I no longer do this professionally, I continue to build.  And now, I build websites. The challenges in this line of work are addictive.</p>
			<p>The obstacle is the way is a philosophy (Stoicism) that works for me and drives me forward,  and this is how I measure my progress.  I see each obstacle as a learning opportunity.  I celebrate my successes (briefly) and I analyse my failures (quickly) then move on.</p>
			<p>I also keep a journal.  I dump the accumulating contents of my brain there on a nearly daily basis. Sometimes I wake up and the first thing I do is reach for my book and start writing. At times it feels like I’m emptying the trash.  It’s also where I give myself a kick in the ass when I need it.  I am now continuing it here, in the form of a blog so check that out too.  There I write what ever is on my mind that particular day, but mostly I will stick to web stuff.</p>
