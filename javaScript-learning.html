		 <h1 class="blog_head">The JavaScript Learning Curve Gets Steep</h1>
		 <p class="sig">January 8, 2017 &nbsp;| &nbsp;Daren Morreale</p>
	 </header>
        <p>JavaScript is proving to be a tough challenge for me. I don't know what I'm doing or why I'm doing it yet and my brain is starting to hurt a little. Good, because it means it's growing - right?. I just read an excerpt from the book "Motzart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot" by Richard Restak, and in it he says that as we learn we are creting new connections in our brains. And as a result our brains gain weight. I wonder what would the diet look like?</p>

        <p>I wasn't expecting it to all be easy, and it's not. It makes no sense to me at this point. I'm just reading, copying and in-putting exactly what I'm being told to. Sometimes it works and sometimes I have to dig a little deeper. But until it clicks it's going to be a grind.</p>

        <p>I worked hard to condition myself to enjoy the grind. It wasn't always that way. I used to give up, a lot. I would think if it was hard that maybe it wasn't for me because it was supposed to be easy. What I learned is anybody can do easy and I have to enjoy the hard grind to master anything. Not everybody can do hard and that's exactly why it's valuable. It's a choice.</p>

        <p>The worst thing I was ever told when I was a kid: You're so telented! Worst thing you can tell any one. Don't tell them they're smart either. We're all the same blank slate when we get here. It's what we do with that blank slate that sets us apart or holds us back. In this line of thinking I take inspiration from the MMA fighter Conor McGregor. He is quoted to have said "...Talent does not exist, we are all equal as human beings. You could be anyone if you put in the time. You will reach the top, and that is that. I am not talented, I am obsessed." I repeat this to myself everyday that I sit down to work on this,

        <p>One technique that is working for me so far is to apprach it from different angles. There are so many resources out there that teach JavaScript that if one apprach doesn't click, I can look for another. Even if it does click, I still try to find a different apprach just to cement the concept. So far it's working.</p>

        <p>At the moment I'm using Codecademy, Udemy's Complete Web Developers course and learn.co's Bootcamp prep course. Each one offers a unique approach to teaching and, combined, seem to be filling in the blanks. I also use Free Code Camp but not as much. I love the concept but the course is not clicking with me for some reason. I read the blog and follow Quincy Larson's posts. Good stuff there.</p>

        <p>Another thing that helps to keep me moving forward is writing stuff down. Not notes about class, but a journal about my plan. I do this about once a week. I think about a strategy to accomplish my plan and revise it as I gather more information. I've made about half a dozen course corrections since I started my journey in mid November.</p>

        <p>Learning to code is hard. I am feeling it and I'm pushing forward. I will be successful, it's just going to take time and effort</p>

        <p>Another quote I get inspiration form is this: "Cease to hope and you will cease to fear". This Quote is from Lucius Annaeus Seneca. I asked myself; why do I fear anything? Most of the time is because I don't know what the outcome will be - the future. How many times did I say to myself that I hope this would work out, I hope I get the job, the girl, the outcome I want. I lived in fear that my hopes would not come to be. Fuck that shit. No more, never again. Hope is for suckers, I am doing everything I can to make this happen. If it doesn't happen it's not going to be because I relied on hope.</p>

        <p>One more thing before I go. A few months ago I asked a friend who had gone through some tough times and landed on his feet - and by all measures a success - what pulled him through the toughest times. His answer was persistence, and always look for an answer. Persistence. That is the backbone of success, at coding and at life. Be persistent.</p>
