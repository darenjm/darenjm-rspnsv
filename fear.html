		<p>This weeks post will be a mostly unedited, stream of conceiousness session I had while riding the bus over two days last week. Here it is.</p>

        <p>Fear is fuel. Anxiety is the exhaust of burning that fuel. If you use fear to move or drive you forward you're staying ahead of the exhaust. If you allow fear to paralyse you you will choke on the fumes. Embrace fear, let it be the fuel for your engine and keep moving forward.</p>

        <p>I learned today from Jocko that one of the ways he is able to lead in stressful and dangerous times, even just function, is he detaches. Usually detaching leads to bad outcomes in everyday life, marriage in particular. But in this case I get it. If you can step back, take a birds eye view of yourself in the moment you can see things. You get perspective that you can't get up close. That is the approach I am going to take during this time of uncertainty and fear. I will stay ahead of the fumes of anxiety. I will detach from the moment and I will guide myself as if I am talking to a friend. I will see my situation from afar and look around and see things I just can't see from the the inside. But also this mimics the old saying easier to say than do, easier said than done. We are all good at giving advice but very few of us can take it. Well here I am the advice giver and the advice taker. I am my own coach. I've written about this in my journal before. I am my own coach. I will coach me through this. I will make sure I never loose faith, or the belief I must have in myself right now. If I do I will encourage me to keep moving. I will hold me accountable to me. I will not let me take a day off. I will push me hard. I will talk to me the way I need to be talked to. Like this: shut the fuck up, stop your whining and get you ass in gear. No body gives a shit about how you feel. No body cares what time you get up or how many hours of sleep you didn't get last night. Fuck you. how me what you got. Don't tell me because I don't believe you. Show me. Like a drill sergeant I will be in your ear every second of every minute of every day. It's your fault so now it's it's your job. Dig.</p>

        <p>I am grateful for this challenge. I am grateful for this hole I am in. It is shaping me into a man. Into a giant. When I get through this test I will be a giant. I will have layered a thick skin of confidence over my psyche that will help me with the next one that is waiting for me on the other side. And the next one will be bigger and badder than this one. Why? Because that is what you earn when you over come obstacles. You earn the privilege of a bigger and badder one. It's a privilege to face these challenges. But more importantly than overcoming them, it's how you coduct yourself as you push ahead, as you stay ahead of the fumes of anxiety. Be. Be the kind of person you admire the most. I admire high moral values and the ability to stand by them even when faced with a strong wind, quiet confidence, humility, generosity, persistence, and kindness.</p>

        <p>Cease to hope and you will cease to fear. Yes, but it requires work. It requires effort. Cease to hope and you will cease to fear means you have got to prepare. It means leaving nothing to chance (or hope). It means doing absolutely everything, everything you can, it means leaving it all out on the field. Every drop of blood, sweat and tears, especially tears. Cry mother fucker, work so hard you are balling your eyes out and when it is done, the results are irrelevant. Because win or lose, succeed or fail, you left it all on the field. You can never ever ask "what if?" Never.</p>

        <p>I will never go to sleep with out reflecting on what I should have or could have done that day to move the chains. I will prepare for the next day with that information in my mind. I will wake up every morning with the thoughts of what I am grateful for. I will motivate myself up and out of bed at 4:30 every morning. If the water is cold, I will take a cold shower. If the water is hot, I will take a hot shower. If it is raining I will take an umbrella. If it is cold I will wear an extra layer, but if it is hot I won't. If the bus is crowded I will stand. If I am having a hard day, I will remind myself to be grateful. If someone else is having a hard day, I will have empathy. If some one blocks my way I will go around. This is all to say that I will not accept any circumstance or condition as an excuse not to move forward. There is no reason not to advance. The obstacles are there to teach me. The impediments are opportunities to grow and learn how to do something differently. Ask this: how can you learn to drive in the snow if it never snows. Yes, I'd prefer to not have to drive in the snow but I am a better driver because I know how. I know because it snowed. If my path to JavaScript proficiency was easy, with out challenges, how good of a programmer would I become? But because I am struggling it is giving me the opportunity to grow. I am learning how to solve problems. I am learning deeply. I am trying all the ways that don't work. So, like T. Edison, I am not succeeding as much as I am running out of ways to fail. Which is good because I know what not to do, and that can be just a valuable as knowing what to do. In some cases.</p>

        <p>I succeeded today. Celebrate, briefly, and then get moving again, on to the next problem. Success is only valuable if I build on it. Today doesn't mean shit if I don't follow up with more success. Because really, I didn't do anything that a million other people didn't already do. Yesterday.</p>

        <p>Now what I want to see me do is pick up a little speed. Not a lot, just 1% will be good. I want to move through these labs a little faster. Put some urgency into it. Put some pressure on it. I've already accomplished my goal and for the week and it’s only Tuesday. Let's get to 3 for the week. In the spirit of under promise, over deliver. Do more than is expected, take less than is deserved. And always remember, no one gives a shit about my personal development.</p>

        <p>And that was it. I do this, write, and dump my mind, my thoughts on to the page. I do it when ever I'm stuck or feel stressed or in this case, I feel sorry for my self. It's become an important tool that I use to continue to move forward. When I go back and read it later I gain valuable insight into my way of thinking. I can see where I go off the rails and I can see where I get it right. What I meant when I wrote it's you fault now it's your job is that I often blame my circumstances for the things that didn't go right, or the way I want. But What I know in reality is that circumstances have nothing to do with it. It was the choices I made in response to my circumstances that got me here. Hence, it's my fault, now, it's my job to make it the way I want it to be. Since writing that last week it has become a new mantra, when ever I feel down about my circumstance I remind my self, it's your fault, now it's your job. Dig.</p>

        <p>Last week was a good one. I also completed an fun exercise: write an essay and envision the life I could have if I pursued  everything I wanted with the certainty that I would be successful at everything I tried. Dream BIG and don't edit. Let the magical quality grow. Milton Glaser gave this assignment to the classes he taught and I learned it form listening to an interview with one of his students on the Tim Ferriss podcast, Debbie Millman. I chose to write it like I was waking up 5 years into the future and writing an entry in my journal like I do most days. It felt weird at first but once I picked up momentum it was incredible. I wrote in detail about what I was doing, the car parked in our driveway, our house, how I was feeling, what I was getting ready to do that day. I wrote about my children and what they were doing. It felt real and I even got a little lost in it like it was already real. After it felt like a real memeory for the rest of the day. Maybe that has something to do with the effectiveness of this exercise.</p>

        <p>In the interview Ms. Millman said she read her essay 5 years after she completed it, maybe her’s was 10, I don’t remember, and she said it was eery how much of it came to be true. I look forward to reading my in 5 years.</p>

        <p>So that was it. I was having a rough time and I need to put it out there to get my self over it. It helped. I read it over a few times during the week too just to reinforce it. It’s amazing that even when I am aware of my self pity I still get caught up in it and it slows me down. But this little exercise helped get out of it. But really not totally, but what it did do was, it helped to keep me moving. And I think that may be a key to success - keep moving even when I don’t feel like it. Keep moving even when the obstacles seem to be too big to move. It was a great lesson and one I will put in the tool box for the next time I’m feeling sorry for myself.</p>

        <p>Thank you for reading and you can be sure I’ll be pushing the rock a few more feet down the road tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. I haven’t missed a day of coding in 79 days and I'm still going strong.</p>

        <p>P.S. I listen to a podcast called the Jocko Podcast. I won't go into detail about the podcast here, if you're curious look it up. But in one episode he was asked a question about struggling and success. And they used the metaphor of sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill and reaching the top only to have it roll back down again. But what if you did get the rock to the top and it stayed there? Finally, success, time to sit back and enjoy life! No way, Jocko replied, if he did get the rock to the top and it didn't roll back down, he'd push it back down himself. I get it. Freud is quoted as saying: “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.” Amen.</p>

      <p>See you next week.</p>
