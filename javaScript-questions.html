        <p>It’s been two weeks now that I started learning JavaScript. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m doing what I’m doing. I am writing a lot of code, more or less copying and pasting. I don’t know if I’m actually learning anything. I’m frustrated and I am having doubts about the path I am on.</p>

        <p>I am questioning whether or not the class I have settled on is the right one. I started out on Udemy with the Complete Web developers Course. From there I switched to Free Code Camp, to Codecademy, then Watch and Code, to Pluralsight and finally to learn.co. I go by my gut most of the time and if it feels right I go for it. Learn.co feels right.</p>

        <p>What I like about learn.co is the quick responses from the experts that always seem to be on. And when they do respond they are patient and helpful. They don’t give me the answer, but they lead me to it so it feels like I figured it out myself. Which I guess I do, but I need a guide to help me in the fog.</p>

        <p>The fear is that I am never going to get it and be able to write or use JavaScript effectively. I don’t know what is going to happen. Guess that is the definition of fear. The questions I ask myself are: am I doing the right things? If I am, am I doing them correctly? What if there is something else out there that is better? A better course, a better language. What if I’m fooling myself even thinking I can learn how to be a web developer in the first place.</p>

        <p>It’s a lot. But I believe in my self now like never before. Except maybe snowboarding. I never doubted my self snowboarding. Always believed I could do it. So that’s probably why using the analogy of learning JavaScript to learning to ride works for me. It was easy to measure my progress on a board. It’s not that easy to measure my progress in code. I have no one to compete with. No one to measure myself against.</p>

        <p>Maybe I just stumbled onto something! Maybe I need to find a way to compete at this. My competitive nature is as it has always been. I’ve been seeing on the internet post about 100 days of code. Maybe the answer lies in there somewhere.</p>

        <p>Ok, been having a hard time focusing on this post. Lots going on in my head. I’m trying to lean on my skills hard to keep focused and not let circumstances affect my performance. It’s just words until the tests come. If I can’t pass the tests then it’s meaningless. So, here it is. Doubt, questions and fear. All here, all wanting a piece of me. Should be an interesting week.</p>

        <p>Here’s what I’m going to do, I am going to keep at learn.co until the end of the month. At that time I will reassess my choice to go with learn.co then either stick with it or make an adjustment. I have a few other options I have been looking at, but I will put them on the back burner until February 1st, which is a Wednesday. So I can get that out of my head at least until then. In the mean time I will put in the maximum effort on learn.co.</p>

        <p>I want to write a little more about the advice my good friend gave me - to be persistent and always look for an answer. I read today a blog post on www.collaborativefund.com (links to the complete blog post). The author of the blog, Morgan Housel, had attended a dinner with Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist. At this dinner Mr. Kahneman talked about persistence. Here is what he said: “When I work I have no sunk costs. I like changing my mind. Some people really don’t like it but for me changing my mind is a thrill. It’s an indication that I’m learning something. So I have no sunk costs in the sense that I can walk away from an idea that I’ve worked on for a year if I can see a better idea. It’s a good attitude for a researcher. The main track that young researchers fall into is sunk costs. They get to work on a project that doesn’t work and that is not promising but they keep at it. I think too much persistence can be bad for you in the intellectual world.”</p>

        <p>I know he isn’t talking about giving up on a plan when ever a better idea come along, but I took it to relate to my goal and my methods of reaching my goal. If I am following one path and I see what might be a better way I will change my mind. So at the end of this month if I feel like I need to change my plan, I will. It is the OODA loop in action - Orient, Observe, Decide, Act. I will be persistent but I will evaluate my methods and change them if I have to.

      <p>I will check in again next week and update my progress. Should be an interesting week.</p>
